**Idle State UX:**

- [ ] Display date in human-friendly format (e.g., "January 12, 2026" instead of "2026-01-12")
- [ ] Remove "X movies to guess" from start screen - let players discover this after starting
- [ ] Update button copy from "Start Challenge" to "Start The Rush"
- [ ] Update timer hint copy from "You'll have 60 seconds to start" to "Once you begin, you'll have 60 seconds"
