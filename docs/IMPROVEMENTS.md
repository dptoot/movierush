## Phase 5 Review

### Phase 3.1 - GameBoard Component

**Idle State UX:**

- [x] Display date in human-friendly format (e.g., "January 12, 2026" instead of "2026-01-12")
- [x] Remove "X movies to guess" from start screen - let players discover this after starting
- [x] Update button copy from "Start Challenge" to "Start The Rush"
- [x] Update timer hint copy from "You'll have 60 seconds to start" to "Once you begin, you'll have 60 seconds"

### Branding & Polish

- [x] Add a logo to the application
- [x] Update the subtitle on the splash page to something more fun/engaging

### Game UI Refinements

- [x] Remove movie posters from autocomplete dropdown (may give away cast hints)
- [x] Move timer and "X/X movies found" counter to the same horizontal line
- [x] Remove "X movies remaining" from the movie grid (redundant with counter)
- [x] Move "End Game" button above the movie list

### Results Page Refinements

- [x] Display points and movies found in matching card-chunky boxes side by side
- [x] Use a theme color that's easier to read on white background for the numbers (e.g., navy or coral instead of gold)
- [x] Move "Come back tomorrow for a new challenge!" to right below the "Game Over!" heading
