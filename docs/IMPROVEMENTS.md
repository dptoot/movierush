## Phase 5 Review

### Phase 3.1 - GameBoard Component

**Idle State UX:**

- [ ] Display date in human-friendly format (e.g., "January 12, 2026" instead of "2026-01-12")
- [ ] Remove "X movies to guess" from start screen - let players discover this after starting
- [ ] Update button copy from "Start Challenge" to "Start The Rush"
- [ ] Update timer hint copy from "You'll have 60 seconds to start" to "Once you begin, you'll have 60 seconds"

### Branding & Polish

- [ ] Add a logo to the application
- [ ] Update the subtitle on the splash page to something more fun/engaging

### Game UI Refinements

- [ ] Remove movie posters from autocomplete dropdown (may give away cast hints)
- [ ] Move timer and "X/X movies found" counter to the same horizontal line
- [ ] Remove "X movies remaining" from the movie grid (redundant with counter)
- [ ] Move "End Game" button above the movie list
